    "summary": "Senior CSC student, future Software Programmer/Systems Administrator. My family's college history led me to West Chester University, and my passion for computer science as a whole has kept me going.\n\nThe CSC department at WCU has provided me an amazing path to learn the basics and even move forward to more advanced fields within the overall computer science field. During my sophomore year I was in a Work Study within the IT department with a focus on Computer Operations. I worked with a server to set up virtual machines with multiple functions.\n\nDuring my second year I focused on Full-Stack web development, mostly with a focus on React and Django. Last summer I had an internship with Stoner Solutions in Quarryville, PA as a Network Admin Intern. I came back this past Winter and plan to intern with them again this coming Summer. I'm planning to dive headfirst into Computer Security and finish out one of my last two semesters.",
